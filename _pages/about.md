Iâ€™m a PhD candidate in Computer Science at Dalhousie University. My research broadly focuses on the applications of (differential) geometry to deep learning; most recently studied how a Riemannian approach to transformer symmetries can recover the relation between sharpness and generalization in transformers, work accepted at ICML 2025  as a Spotlight Poster. I previously trained in theoretical and astrophysical physics, which might be where I got the notion to study geometry for deep learning.
