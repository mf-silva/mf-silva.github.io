## RESEARCH EXPERIENCE

**Researcher at the University of Porto** Jan. 2020 – Jan. 2021  
- Project: “Safe Cities", an industry research grant resulting from a collaboration with Bosch GmbH.  
- Analysis of large-scale time series data and work on the development of novel deep learning techniques.  
- Supervisor: Dr. Vítor Santos Costa (University of Porto)

**Master thesis at the Weizmann Institute of Science** Oct. 2017 – May. 2019  
- Project: “A model for pulsar magnetospheres"  
- Through the use of numerical simulations, check the Gruzinov model of the pulsar magnetosphere against experimental observation, taking advantage of data from LAT.  
- Supervisor: Dr. Doron Kushnir (Weizmann Institute of Science)

**Researcher at CRACS-INESC TEC** May 2016 – Sept. 2016  
- Project: “Learning From Replicated Examples"  
- Work on improving classification performance in Machine Learning by leveraging replicated experi-

  ments.  
- Supervisor: Dr. Vítor Santos Costa (University of Porto)

**Perimeter Scholars Essay** Dec. 2014 – Jul. 2015  
- Project: “New KLT Relations"
- Work on the scattering of massless particles: investigating some results offered by the rethinking of
  arbitrarily dimensional scattering of massless particles in terms of variables in a n-punctured sphere.
- Supervisor: Dr. Freddy Cachazo (Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics)

**Undergraduate Researcher at CAUP** Dec. 2011 – Jul. 2014  
- Project: “Spatial variations of the fine-structure constant in symmetron models"  
- Conducted N-Body computer simulations on a modified gravity theory which predicts a varying fine-

  structure constant, in order to conclude about its viability (taking into account experimental data).  
- Supervisor: Carlos J.A.P Martins (Centre for Astrophysics of the University of Porto)

## TEACHING EXPERIENCE

**Mentor at the Porto Business School** Apr. 2023 – Present  
- Mentored groups of 4-5 post-graduate students in the execution of a data science project using the CRISP-DM methodology and industry provided data.  
- Provided guidance on specific machine learning methods, and how best to tailor them to the data science project undertaken by the students.

**Teaching Assistant for CSCI 1109 (Practical Data Science) at Dalhousie University** Sep. 2022 – Apr. 2023  
- Delivered introductory lectures on Python.  
- Provided introduction to basic data science packages and pipelines in Python.

**Teaching Assistant and Marker for CSCI 6516 (Deep Learning) at Dalhousie University** May – Aug. 2022  
- Presented some lectures on introductory neural training dynamics.  
- Devised tutorials to reinforce material covered by the lectures of the main instructor.  
- Created assignments to both test student knowledge and engage them in a process of guided discovery, distilling some research papers into assignments incentivizing critical thinking.  
- Marked assignments and research paper presentations.

**Head Teaching Assistant and Marker for CSCI 4155/6505 (Machine Learning) at Dalhousie University** Jan.
– May. 2022

- Helped develop material for lectures.  
- Created assignments to both test student knowledge and engage them in a process of guided discovery, scaffolding assignments in order to facilitate learning.  
- Both marked assignments and complex project submissions, and helped coordinate markers and other TAs.
